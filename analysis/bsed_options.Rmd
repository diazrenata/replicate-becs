```{r setup}
library(replicatebecs)
download_data = FALSE
source_sims = FALSE
set.seed(352) # GNV area code, for fun
```

This is a deeper dive into the outcomes of the BSED analyses using different assumptions in the bootstrapping. 

### Load data and prepare distributions

```{r load data}
if(download_data) download_raw_paper_data()
process_raw_data()
communities <- load_paper_data()
communities_energy <- lapply(communities, FUN = make_community_table, ln_units = 0.2)
bseds <- lapply(communities_energy, FUN = make_bsed)
```

## No energetic constraint

### Uniform size-abundance by .1g (presumed paper approach)

### Uniform size-energy by X units

### Uniform size-abundance by size class

### Uniform size-energy by size class

## Energetically constrained
