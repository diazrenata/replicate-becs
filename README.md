# replicate-becs

This repo will contain a replication of Ernest 2005 working from the description of the analysis in the paper and publicly available copies of the data used. 

It's beginning with code from diazrenata/revisitbecs, which is where the replication project started. That repo is now going to develop towards asking related questions with more modern computational methods and a larger dataset (drawing largely from NEON).
